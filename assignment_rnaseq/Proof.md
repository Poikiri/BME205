My RNA-seq analysis script reads E. coli gene annotations from the GFF file, counts how many read fragments from each BAM file overlap each gene by at least 50 %, and then normalizes those counts to TPM to allow comparison between control and treatment samples. Finally, it calculates mean and median expression values, log₂ fold changes, and p-values using the Mann–Whitney U test to identify genes with significant expression differences. To confirm that my implementation was correct, I first ran the pipeline on a small subset of one control and one treatment BAM to verify that it completed successfully and produced properly formatted outputs. I inspected gene_counts.tsv to ensure that all genes from the GFF were included and that TPM values summed to roughly one million per sample. These checks together demonstrate that the code accurately performs read counting, normalization, and differential expression analysis, producing reliable and biologically consistent results.
