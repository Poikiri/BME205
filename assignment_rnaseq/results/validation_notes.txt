Validation checklist:
- Mapping quality filter: MAPQ >= 10
- Proper pairs only; each template counted once via read1
- ≥50% overlap rule enforced using aligned fragment blocks
- Proportional assignment when fragment overlaps multiple genes
- gene_counts.tsv includes all genes from GFF (zeros possible)
- TPM computed per sample; sums to ~1e6 per sample
- Low-count filter: drop genes with total raw count < 10 before DE
- Mann–Whitney U two-sided between control and treatment TPMs
- log2FC = log2( (mean_treatment+1)/(mean_control+1) )
